# Traffic-Congestion-EDA
The objective of this project is to study the effectiveness of various machine learning models for the analysis and forecasting of a road traffic data timeseries. Subsequently, the most suitable model for the use-case has been determined and a prototype application called Traffic Congestion Management System is developed using R and Shiny Dashboard. The web application can predict the traffic conditions for a particular road intersection by training with the traffic data in a timeseries format.

This repository is the exploratory data analysis for the road traffic dataset used in the Traffic Congestion project. The EDA is performed using Python and its libraries - statsmodel, matplotlib, pandas and numpy. Check the Jupyter Notebook <a href='Traffic Congestion - Data Exploration.ipynb'>here</a>.
